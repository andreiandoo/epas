# Are You a Festival Organiser?

## Scale Your Festival Without Scaling Your Stress

Festivals are different. Tens of thousands of attendees. Multiple stages. Multi-day passes. Camping add-ons. VIP experiences. Payment plans. Group sales. Volunteer credentials. Artist guests. Media passes. Sponsor obligations.

Generic ticketing platforms weren't built for this complexity. Tixello was.

## Tixello Handles Festival Scale

### On-Sales That Don't Fail

Your lineup announcement drops. Social media explodes. Thousands of fans hit your ticket page simultaneously. This is either your greatest moment or your worst nightmare.

**Elastic infrastructure** scales automatically to handle any traffic spike. We've processed 100,000+ sessions in minutes without degrading performance. Your fans get tickets. Your reputation stays intact.

**Queue management** creates fair access during high-demand moments. Randomized positioning prevents refresh attacks. Estimated wait times keep fans informed. Abandoned spots release to others.

**Countdown timers** build anticipation before on-sales. Customers can't purchase early, but they can prepare. When the clock hits zero, transactions flow smoothly.

### Ticket Types as Complex as Your Festival

Three-day passes. Single-day tickets. VIP upgrades. Camping add-ons. Glamping packages. Parking permits. Lockers. Meal plans. Early entry. Late night access. Artist meet-and-greets.

**Unlimited ticket categories** accommodate any structure. Create as many types as your festival needs. Bundle them into packages. Offer upgrades after purchase.

**Add-on architecture** attaches extras to any ticket type. Camping requires a festival pass? Enforce it automatically. VIP parking limited to VIP tickets? No problem.

**Capacity management** handles complex scenarios. Overall festival capacity. Per-day limits. Stage-specific access. Camping zone allocation. Each constraint enforces independently.

### Payment Plans That Sell Premium Tickets

That €500 VIP package looks expensive on announcement day. But €50/month for 10 months? Suddenly accessible.

**Installment payments** let fans secure tickets now and pay over time. You define the schedule. Automatic charges collect payments. Failed payments retry with smart logic.

**Deposit + balance** structures work for traditional layaway. Collect a deposit at purchase, balance before the festival. Reminder emails keep customers on track.

**Revenue flows to you** even while customers are paying. Don't wait until the final installment to receive funds.

### Group Sales for Superfans and Travel Partners

Festival tourism is real. Travel agencies package tickets with transportation and accommodation. Friend groups coordinate massive purchases. Bachelor and bachelorette parties arrive by the busload.

**Group booking portal** handles bulk inquiries professionally. Custom pricing for volume. Professional quotes with your branding. Flexible payment terms.

**Allocation management** reserves inventory for groups before confirmation. Release holds automatically if deals don't close. Protect your general sale while serving group buyers.

**Attendee management** lets group leaders handle their own logistics. Names, preferences, and contact details—without your involvement.

### Wristbands, Credentials, and Access Control

Festivals run on wristbands. Color-coded for access levels. RFID for cashless payments. Scannable for entry verification.

**Multi-credential support** issues different bands for different access levels. General admission, VIP, all-access, backstage, camping, parking—each with distinct verification.

**Integration with wristband providers** connects your ticketing data to physical fulfillment. Attendee data flows to encoding systems. Personalization happens automatically.

**Check-in at scale** handles festival arrival dynamics. Multiple entry lanes. Express lines for VIP. Re-entry tracking for camping festivals. All syncing in real-time.

### Real-Time Festival Intelligence

During the festival, you need answers fast. How many people are on-site? Which stage is at capacity? Is camping full? Are we hitting F&B targets?

**Live dashboards** display key metrics as they happen. Attendance by gate, by hour, by day. Capacity utilization across zones. Revenue across all channels.

**Alerts** notify you when thresholds hit. Camping at 90% capacity? You'll know immediately. VIP parking sold out? Time to close that add-on.

**Mobile access** puts data in your pocket. Walk the grounds while monitoring operations. Make decisions with current information.

### Marketing That Fills Festivals

Selling 50,000 tickets requires serious marketing muscle. Tixello's tools were built for festival-scale promotion.

**Affiliate programs** turn your community into salespeople. Ambassadors, influencers, street teams—each with tracking links and commission structures. Reward your best promoters.

**Presale management** creates urgency and rewards loyalty. Artist presales, newsletter presales, sponsor presales—each with unique access windows and codes.

**Waitlist conversion** captures demand beyond capacity. When tickets release or capacity expands, notify waitlist subscribers automatically.

**Retargeting integration** with Facebook, Google, and TikTok tracks conversions server-side. Optimize ad spend with accurate data. Build lookalike audiences from your buyers.

### Complete Festival Financials

Festival finances involve multiple revenue streams, numerous cost centers, and complex stakeholder relationships. Clarity is essential.

**Revenue breakdown** separates ticket sales, add-ons, merchandise, and fees. Understand where money comes from.

**Stakeholder reporting** generates views for different parties. Artist guarantees and bonuses. Sponsor deliverables. Investor updates. Each sees relevant data.

**Multi-currency support** handles international festivals and foreign ticket buyers. Clear exchange rate tracking and reporting.
