# About Tixello

## We're Building the Future of Event Ticketing

Tixello started with a simple observation: event organizers deserve better tools. The ticketing industry was dominated by platforms that prioritized their own growth over the success of the events they served. High fees, hidden charges, locked-in customer data, and one-size-fits-all solutions that never quite fit.

We believed there was a better way.

## Our Story

Tixello was born from frustration. Our founders spent years in the event industry—organizing festivals, managing venues, promoting concerts. They experienced firsthand the limitations of existing ticketing platforms. The astronomical fees that ate into razor-thin margins. The customer data that disappeared into platform databases. The rigid systems that couldn't adapt to how events actually work.

In 2020, we started building the platform we wished existed. A ticketing solution designed by people who understand events, for people who create them.

Today, Tixello powers thousands of events across Europe. From intimate club nights to major festivals, from corporate conferences to grassroots community gatherings. We've processed millions of tickets and helped organizers build direct relationships with their audiences.

But we're just getting started.

## What We Believe

### Events Deserve Better Technology

The event industry runs on passion, creativity, and incredibly hard work. The technology supporting it should match that dedication. We build tools that are powerful enough for complex operations yet simple enough for first-time organizers.

### Your Customers Are YOUR Customers

When someone buys a ticket to your event, they're connecting with you—not with a ticketing platform. You should own that relationship. That means having access to your customer data, communicating directly with your audience, and building your brand without interference.

### Pricing Should Be Fair and Transparent

Hidden fees and surprise charges erode trust. We believe you should know exactly what you're paying before you commit. Our pricing is straightforward, competitive, and designed to leave more money with the people creating events.

### Flexibility Beats Rigidity

No two events are the same. Your ticketing platform should adapt to your needs, not force you into predetermined boxes. That's why we built Tixello as a modular system—use what you need, skip what you don't.

### Technology Should Empower, Not Complicate

Powerful features mean nothing if they're impossible to use. We obsess over user experience, making complex capabilities accessible to everyone. You shouldn't need a technical background to run professional ticketing.

## Our Approach

### Modular by Design

Tixello isn't a monolithic platform. It's a collection of specialized microservices that work together seamlessly. Need advanced CRM? Enable it. Want affiliate tracking? Turn it on. Prefer to keep things simple? Use only the core features.

This modular architecture means you're never paying for capabilities you don't use. It also means the platform evolves continuously—new features and integrations arrive regularly without disrupting your operations.

### Local Understanding, Global Standards

We're a European company with deep roots in our home markets. We understand local payment preferences, regulatory requirements, and cultural nuances. At the same time, we build to global standards—security, reliability, and scalability that match the best platforms anywhere.

### Partner, Not Vendor

We succeed when our customers succeed. That's not marketing speak—it's our business model. Our fees are based on ticket sales, which means we're genuinely invested in helping you sell more tickets. When you thrive, we thrive.

## Our Values

### Transparency
No hidden fees. No buried terms. No surprises. We communicate clearly and honestly, even when the message is difficult.

### Reliability
Events can't fail. When doors open, everything must work. We build redundant systems, test obsessively, and maintain the infrastructure events depend on.

### Innovation
The event industry evolves constantly. We stay ahead by listening to organizers, watching trends, and continuously improving our platform.

### Support
Questions get answered. Problems get solved. Real people respond to real issues. We're in this together.

### Respect
For organizers building businesses. For artists creating art. For fans seeking experiences. For everyone working to bring people together.

## The Team

Tixello is built by a team that combines deep event industry experience with technical excellence.

Our leadership has organized events ranging from 50-person workshops to 50,000-person festivals. We've managed venues, run box offices, handled artist hospitality, and stood at festival gates at 3 AM troubleshooting scanning issues. We know what it's like because we've lived it.

Our engineering team brings experience from leading technology companies. They've built systems that scale, designed interfaces that users love, and created infrastructure that never sleeps.

Together, we're creating the ticketing platform we always wanted to use.
