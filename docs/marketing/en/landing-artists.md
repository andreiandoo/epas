# Are You an Artist?

## Own Your Audience. Control Your Tickets. Keep More of Your Money.

You create the art. You build the fanbase. You deserve a direct relationship with the people who love your work—without platforms taking massive cuts or hiding your fans behind their brand.

Tixello puts artists in control. Sell tickets directly to your audience. Keep your customer data. Build your career on your terms.

## The Artist's Ticketing Problem

The traditional model is broken. You work for years building a following, and when fans finally want to see you live:

- **Ticketing platforms take huge fees** and pass even more to customers
- **You never see who bought tickets** because platforms keep that data
- **Your brand disappears** behind generic ticketing websites
- **Scalpers grab tickets** and resell them at markups you never see
- **You can't communicate directly** with people who love your music

There's a better way.

## Tixello Gives Artists Power

### Your Brand, Your Store

When fans buy tickets to your show, they should feel like they're connecting with YOU—not some corporate ticketing site.

**Custom-branded pages** put your identity front and center. Your photos, your colors, your voice. Every touchpoint reinforces your brand.

**Your domain** (or a clean Tixello URL) keeps the experience consistent. Fans never feel like they've left your world to buy tickets.

**White-label emails** carry your branding. Confirmations, reminders, and updates all come from you, not from us.

### Know Your Fans

Every fan who buys a ticket should become part of YOUR community, not some platform's database.

**Direct customer data** goes to you. Email addresses, purchase history, location data—everything you need to build relationships.

**Export anywhere** takes your data to any email platform, CRM, or marketing tool you use. No lock-in. No restrictions.

**Segment and communicate** based on behavior. Message your superfans differently than first-timers. Reward loyalty. Build community.

### Fair, Transparent Pricing

You shouldn't need a finance degree to understand what you're paying. And fans shouldn't feel gouged at checkout.

**Clear fee structure** shows exactly what Tixello charges. Small percentage plus minimal per-ticket fee. No hidden costs.

**You choose who pays fees.** Pass them to customers, absorb them yourself, or split them. Your call.

**Keep more revenue** compared to traditional ticketing. Lower fees mean more money in your pocket from every ticket sold.

### Fight the Scalpers

Bots and scalpers exploit your popularity while pricing out real fans. Tixello helps you fight back.

**Queue management** creates fair access during high-demand sales. Real fans get tickets, not scripts.

**Transfer controls** let you decide if and how tickets can be resold. Allow transfers only at face value. Or prevent transfers entirely.

**Fan verification** options ensure tickets go to real people. Require account creation, limit purchases per person, verify at door.

### Presales That Reward Loyalty

Your biggest fans should get first access. Email subscribers, fan club members, Patreon supporters—they deserve priority.

**Unlimited presale windows** create exclusive access periods. Newsletter presale, fan club presale, credit card presale—as many tiers as you want.

**Unique access codes** track which channels perform best. See which fan segments buy first and fastest.

**Waitlist capture** for sold-out shows builds your audience even when you can't sell more tickets. Those email addresses become your next show's first customers.

### VIP Experiences and Merchandise

Shows aren't just tickets anymore. Fans want experiences, and those experiences drive revenue.

**VIP packages** bundle premium access with extras. Meet-and-greets, soundcheck access, signed merchandise, photo opportunities—whatever makes sense for your show.

**Add-ons at checkout** capture impulse buys. That limited-edition poster, the tour hoodie, the commemorative ticket. Fans buy when they're excited.

**Post-purchase upsells** reach fans who bought basic tickets. Upgrade to VIP before the show. Add that hoodie they passed on initially.

### Simple Setup, Professional Results

You have enough complexity in your life. Ticketing should be simple.

**Launch in minutes** with our intuitive event builder. Add your details, set your prices, upload your images, go live.

**Mobile-perfect** event pages look stunning on every device. Most fans browse on phones—your tickets page will convert them.

**One dashboard** shows everything. Sales, revenue, attendance, demographics. Know your business at a glance.

### Tour Management Made Easy

One show is straightforward. A 20-city tour? That's where most platforms fall apart.

**Clone events** to create tour dates quickly. Set up one show, duplicate for every city, adjust details.

**Cross-show analytics** reveal tour-wide patterns. Which cities sell fastest? Which ticket types move? Where should you add dates?

**Unified customer view** combines fans across all shows. That superfan who bought tickets in three cities? You'll know.

### Integration With Your World

Your ticketing platform should work with everything else you use.

**Email integration** syncs with Mailchimp, Klaviyo, and other platforms. Customer data flows automatically.

**Social pixels** from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok track conversions. Optimize your ad spend with accurate data.

**Spotify and streaming** data can inform your marketing. Play counts and listener locations help you route tours.

**Merch platforms** connect for unified customer views. See who buys tickets AND merch.
