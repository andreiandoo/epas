# Are You an Event Organiser?

## Everything You Need to Sell Out Every Event

You create experiences. Concerts, conferences, workshops, parties, galas, sporting events—whatever brings people together. Your ticketing platform should amplify your creativity, not limit it.

Tixello gives event organisers professional-grade tools without enterprise complexity. Sell tickets, understand your audience, and grow your events—all from one platform.

## The Event Organiser's Journey

You started organising events because you're passionate about bringing people together. Somewhere along the way, you became an expert in spreadsheets, payment disputes, and customer service emails.

**What if your ticketing platform actually helped?**

Not just processing transactions, but genuinely supporting your growth:
- Selling more tickets through better conversion
- Understanding who attends and why
- Building an audience that returns event after event
- Automating the tedious work so you can focus on the experience
- Giving you data to make smarter decisions

## Tixello Makes Event Success Simple

### Launch Events in Minutes, Not Hours

Your next great idea shouldn't wait for technical setup. Tixello's event builder gets you from concept to ticket sales fast.

**Intuitive creation** guides you through event setup. Add your details, configure ticket types, set your pricing, and publish. No training manual required.

**Templates** save your common configurations. Weekly events? Clone last week's setup. Recurring series? Create once, schedule forever.

**Preview before publishing** lets you see exactly what customers will experience. Test the purchase flow. Check your mobile appearance. Launch with confidence.

### Tickets That Match Your Vision

Your event isn't one-size-fits-all, and your tickets shouldn't be either. Create exactly the experience you want to sell.

**Multiple ticket types** accommodate any structure. Early bird and regular pricing. VIP and general admission. Tables and individual seats. Student and senior discounts.

**Time-based pricing** creates urgency. Prices increase automatically as dates approach. Countdown timers show customers why buying now matters.

**Add-ons and upgrades** increase revenue per ticket. Parking, merchandise, food packages, meet-and-greets—bundle extras with tickets or sell separately.

**Discount codes** power your promotions. Percentage off, fixed discounts, buy-one-get-one—whatever drives your marketing. Track which codes perform best.

### Beautiful Event Pages That Convert

Your event page is your sales pitch. It needs to look stunning and drive action.

**Mobile-optimized design** ensures perfect display on every device. More than 70% of ticket buyers browse on phones. Your page will convert them.

**Media integration** brings your event to life. Hero videos, photo galleries, artist embeds—show visitors what they'll experience.

**Social proof elements** build confidence. Testimonials, attendance counters, urgency indicators. Turn browsers into buyers.

**SEO optimization** helps people find you. Proper meta tags, structured data, fast loading—your events rank in search results.

### Understand Your Audience

You can't grow what you don't measure. Tixello reveals who attends your events and how to reach more people like them.

**Customer profiles** build automatically from purchases. Every ticket buyer joins your database with contact info and history.

**Segmentation tools** group customers by behavior. First-time attendees vs. regulars. High spenders vs. deal seekers. Geographic clusters. Marketing becomes targeted.

**Acquisition tracking** shows where customers come from. Which ads work? Which influencers drive sales? Which emails convert? Invest in what works.

**Attendance analytics** reveal actual behavior. Who bought but didn't show? When did people arrive? Which ticket types had highest attendance rates?

### Marketing That Fills Rooms

Selling tickets requires reaching the right people with the right message. Tixello's marketing tools were built specifically for events.

**Email campaigns** reach your audience directly. Drag-and-drop builder creates professional emails. Automated triggers send announcements, reminders, and follow-ups.

**Affiliate tracking** rewards your promoters. Give partners and influencers unique links. Track their sales. Calculate commissions automatically.

**Social integration** amplifies your reach. Easy sharing to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Open Graph optimization makes shares look great.

**Retargeting pixels** from Facebook, Google, and TikTok track visitor behavior. Build audiences from page viewers. Target people who started but didn't finish checkout.

**Waitlist management** captures excess demand. When you sell out, collect interested contacts. Notify them if tickets become available.

### Checkout That Actually Converts

Complicated checkout kills sales. Every extra click loses customers. Tixello's checkout is designed for one thing: converting visitors into ticket holders.

**Streamlined flow** minimizes steps. Customers complete purchases in under 60 seconds. Mobile-optimized for thumb-friendly buying.

**Multiple payment options** meet customers where they are. Credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, local payment methods. No sale lost to payment limitations.

**Abandoned cart recovery** reaches customers who didn't complete purchase. Automated emails remind them to finish. Recover up to 15% of lost sales.

**Upselling at checkout** increases average order value. Suggest add-ons, upgrades, and related events at the perfect moment.

### Finances Made Clear

Event money is complicated enough without your ticketing platform making it worse. Tixello provides complete financial clarity.

**Real-time revenue** shows exactly where you stand. Watch sales accumulate. Know your numbers before you ask.

**Fee transparency** means no surprises. Know exactly what you'll pay before every event. Calculate net revenue accurately.

**Multiple processors** give you options. Stripe for global reach. Regional processors for local optimization. You choose what works best.

**Payout control** lets you decide when you get paid. Immediate deposits, scheduled payouts, or hold until after the event.

**Invoicing and compliance** handles the paperwork. Proper documentation for every transaction. VAT handling. E-invoicing integration for business sales.

### Check-In Without Chaos

The door experience matters. Smooth entry sets the tone for your entire event. Chaotic lines poison the atmosphere before it starts.

**Free scanning apps** turn any smartphone into a ticket scanner. iOS and Android. Download, login, scan.

**Sub-second validation** keeps lines moving. Clear visual and audio confirmation. Staff knows immediately if tickets are valid.

**Offline capability** ensures scanning works even without internet. Data syncs when connection returns.

**Real-time attendance** shows who's actually there. Monitor arrivals from anywhere. Know when to open more lines or close the doors.

### Support When You Need It

Events don't happen during business hours. Neither does our support.

**Responsive help** when issues arise. Real people who understand events, not scripts.

**Comprehensive documentation** answers most questions instantly. Step-by-step guides, video tutorials, FAQs.

**Proactive monitoring** catches problems before you notice them. We're watching so you can focus on your event.
