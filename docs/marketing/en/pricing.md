# Pricing

## Pay Only for What You Use

Tixello uses a modular pricing model. Start with our core ticketing platform, then add only the features you need. No bundles forcing you to pay for things you'll never use. No enterprise packages when you just need one extra feature.

---

## How Our Pricing Works

### Core Platform Fee

Every ticket sold through Tixello includes a small platform fee:

| Component | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| **Service Fee** | 2% of ticket price |
| **Per-Ticket Fee** | €0.50 per ticket |

**Example:** A €50 ticket costs €1.00 (2%) + €0.50 = **€1.50 total platform fee**

These fees cover:
- Event page hosting and management
- Ticket delivery (email, SMS, mobile wallet)
- Customer support
- Check-in apps and scanning
- Basic reporting and analytics
- Payment processing integration

### Who Pays the Fees?

**You decide.** Three options:

1. **Pass to customer:** Fees added on top of ticket price. Customer pays €51.50 for a €50 ticket.

2. **Absorb fees:** You pay from ticket revenue. Customer pays €50, you receive €48.50.

3. **Split fees:** Share costs however you prefer. Common: customer pays per-ticket fee, you absorb percentage.

## Microservices: Add What You Need

Beyond core ticketing, Tixello offers specialized microservices. Each adds specific functionality to your account. Enable them when needed, disable when you don't.

### How Microservices Work

Microservices are modular features that extend your Tixello account. Think of them as apps in an app store—each one adds a specific capability without affecting anything else.

**Activation:** Turn microservices on or off from your dashboard. Most activate instantly. Some require brief configuration.

**Billing:** Each microservice has its own pricing—some charge per use, others are monthly subscriptions, and some are included free with certain volume levels.

**Independence:** Microservices work independently. Adding CRM doesn't require Analytics. Enabling WhatsApp doesn't need Zapier. Use exactly the combination your events require.

## Payment Processing

Tixello integrates with multiple payment processors. Each has its own transaction fees, which are separate from Tixello's platform fees.

### Supported Processors

| Processor | Best For | Typical Rates |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Stripe** | Global reach, digital wallets | 1.4% + €0.25 (EU cards) |
| **Netopia** | Romania | 1.5% - 2.5% |
| **PayU** | Central/Eastern Europe | 1.5% - 2.5% |
| **EuPlatesc** | Romania | 1.2% - 2.0% |

You choose your processor(s). You can use different processors for different events or regions. Payment processing fees go directly to the processor—Tixello doesn't mark them up.
