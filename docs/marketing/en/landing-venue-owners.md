# Are You a Venue Owner?

## Your Venue Deserves a Ticketing Partner, Not Just a Platform

You've invested everything in your venue. The acoustics, the sightlines, the atmosphere—every detail matters. Your ticketing should match that commitment. Tixello gives venue owners complete control over their ticketing operation while handling the complexity behind the scenes.

## The Venue Owner's Challenge

Running a venue means juggling countless demands. You're managing multiple promoters, coordinating events across different spaces, and trying to maintain consistent customer experiences. Generic ticketing platforms treat you like just another client. They don't understand that your venue is the star—not the events passing through.

You need a system that:
- Reflects your venue's identity, not some platform's branding
- Handles multiple promoters without chaos
- Gives you visibility into everything happening in your spaces
- Protects your customer relationships
- Grows revenue without growing your workload

## Tixello Was Built for Venues Like Yours

### Your Brand, Your Domain, Your Customers

When someone buys a ticket to an event at your venue, they should remember *your* venue—not some ticketing website. Tixello operates invisibly behind your brand.

**Custom domains** put tickets at yourvenename.com. SSL certificates install automatically. Your logo, your colors, your voice appear everywhere from event pages to email confirmations to mobile wallet tickets.

**Customer data stays yours.** Build your audience with every event. Whether you're hosting a touring artist, a local promoter's show, or your own programming, every ticket buyer joins your database. Segment, market, and build loyalty across all events in your space.

### Multiple Promoters, Zero Headaches

Your venue hosts events from different promoters, each with their own needs. Tixello's multi-promoter architecture handles this elegantly.

**Promoter portals** give each partner access to manage their own events. They create listings, set prices, and monitor sales—within boundaries you define. You maintain oversight without micromanaging.

**Revenue sharing** configures automatically. Define your split, and the system handles calculations. No more spreadsheets, no more disputes. Every party sees exactly what they're owed.

**Permissions control** everything. Marketing teams see reports but can't issue refunds. Box office staff sell tickets but can't change prices. Door staff scan tickets but can't access financials. Everyone gets exactly the access they need.

### Seating Charts That Actually Work

Your venue isn't a rectangle with rows. It's a unique space with sections, tiers, accessible seating, and configurations that change by event. Tixello handles this complexity.

**Visual chart builder** creates accurate representations of your space. Import CAD files or build from scratch. Define every section, row, and seat. Set different pricing zones. Show obstructed views.

**Multiple configurations** store different layouts. Theater style one night, cabaret the next, standing room for concerts. Switch between saved layouts instantly.

**Real-time availability** updates across all sales channels. Online, box office, and promoter allocations draw from one inventory. No double-selling, no confusion.

### Box Office That Belongs in 2025

Walk-up sales matter. Festival crowds, last-minute decisions, tourists who didn't plan ahead—they all arrive at your door ready to buy.

**Point-of-sale integration** turns tablets into professional terminals. Cash, cards, mobile payments—all accepted. Will-call lookup finds reservations instantly.

**Unified inventory** means door sales see the same availability as online. Sell that last seat with confidence.

**Cash management** tracks every transaction. Drawer reconciliation, shift reports, and full audit trails satisfy your accountants.

### Know Everything That Happens in Your Venue

Visibility shouldn't require chasing promoters for spreadsheets. Tixello's reporting gives you real-time insight.

**Cross-event dashboards** show performance across your entire calendar. Compare Saturday night jazz to Sunday matinees. Identify your best-selling configurations.

**Promoter performance** becomes visible. See which partners fill your room and which struggle. Make informed decisions about future bookings.

**Attendance analytics** reveal patterns. When do people arrive? How many actually show? Which events drive no-shows? Optimize your operations with data.

### Financial Clarity

Event finances get complicated fast. Multiple promoters, different splits, various payment processors, tax requirements—it's easy to lose track.

**Automated reconciliation** matches payments to orders. Know exactly what came in and from where.

**Revenue sharing** calculates automatically based on your agreements. Promoters see their share. You see yours. No arguments.

**Compliance built in.** VAT handling, e-invoicing integration (including Romanian eFactura), and proper documentation for every transaction.
